Notes - LMR (continued)
[REDACTED-ADDRESS-6] Course and [redacted-address-6] Decision Making:
| considered 123 dummy street, dummy city differential diagnosis of cervical spine strain or fracture, thoracic spine strain or fracture,
concern for rib fracture or chest wall contusion or pulmonary contusion. Patient otherwise looks well, denies
any significant head trauma, denies being on blood thinners, and | do not feel she needs cranial imaging.
We will do 123 dummy street, dummy city CT scan of her T-spine and C-spine and chest x-ray.
She is medicated with Tylenol.
Bedside
E-FAST ultrasound was negative [redacted-address-5] done by [redacted-address-6]
Clinical complexity is moderate.
Work-up results:
| independently reviewed the results of each diagnostic test, which showed: Negative chest x-ray, and no
evidence of fracture or misalignment on CT of the cervical and thoracic spines, though she does have
degenerative changes.
| independently reviewed the images interpreted (or being interpreted) by Radiology and formed my own
impression.
Observation Care:
Patient was entered into observation care.
Evaluation began at 01-01-1900 AM in the emergency department.
Serial examinations and reassessments were performed on this patient to determine if they would
improve versus require further intervention, testing, or admission.
123 Dummy Street, Dummy City is currently 10:30 AM, and the patient is improved after Tylenol and ibuprofen and 123 DUMMY STREET, DUMMY CITY will plan to
discharge her home with prescriptions for Tylenol, ibuprofen, lidocaine patches.

There are seven
bones (vertebrae) inthe neck that are part of the spine.
These are called the cervical spine. Cervical strain
is 123 dummy street, dummy city [redacted-address-6] term for neck pain. The neck has several layers of muscles. These are connected with tendons tothe cervical
spine and other bones. Neck pain isoften the result of injury to these muscles and tendons.
Different types of stress on the neck can damage muscles and tendons (soft tissues) and cause cervical strain. Cervical
tissues can be damaged by:
+The neck being forced past its normal range of motion, such [redacted-address-5] in acar accident or sports injury
+ Constant, low-level stress, such
[redacted-address-5] from poor posture or 123 dummy street, dummy city poorly set upworkspace
These may include:
+ Neck pain or stiffness
Pain in the shouiders or upper back
Muscle spasms
Headache, often starting at the base of the neck
+trritability,
troubée concentrating, or sleeplessness

inthe arm
This problem often gets better on itsown. Treatments aim tc reduce pain and inflammation and increase the range of
