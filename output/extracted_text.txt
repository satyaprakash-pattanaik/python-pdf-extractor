03/01/2024 - ED inScripps Mercy Hospital San Diego Emergency Department (continued)
Notes - LMR (continued)
ED Course and Medical Decision Making:
| considered a differential diagnosis of cervical spine strain or fracture, thoracic spine strain or fracture,
concern for rib fracture or chest wall contusion or pulmonary contusion. Patient otherwise looks well, denies
any significant head trauma, denies being on blood thinners, and | do not feel she needs cranial imaging.
We will do a CT scan of her T-spine and C-spine and chest x-ray.
She is medicated with Tylenol.
Bedside
E-FAST ultrasound was negative as done by me.
Clinical complexity is moderate.
Work-up results:
| independently reviewed the results of each diagnostic test, which showed: Negative chest x-ray, and no
evidence of fracture or misalignment on CT of the cervical and thoracic spines, though she does have
degenerative changes.
| independently reviewed the images interpreted (or being interpreted) by Radiology and formed my own
impression.
Observation Care:
Patient was entered into observation care.
Evaluation began at 8 AM in the emergency department.
Serial examinations and reassessments were performed on this patient to determine if they would
improve versus require further intervention, testing, or admission.
It is currently 10:30 AM, and the patient is improved after Tylenol and ibuprofen and I will plan to
discharge her home with prescriptions for Tylenol, ibuprofen, lidocaine patches.
Clinical Impression:
1.
Cervical strain, acute, initial encounter
2.
Thoracic myofascial strain, initial encounter
3.
Motor vehicle accident (victim), initial encounter
Disposition:

Documents (continued)
There are seven
bones (vertebrae) inthe neck that are part of the spine.
These are called the cervical spine. Cervical strain
is a medical term for neck pain. The neck has several layers of muscles. These are connected with tendons tothe cervical
spine and other bones. Neck pain isoften the result of injury to these muscles and tendons.
Different types of stress on the neck can damage muscles and tendons (soft tissues) and cause cervical strain. Cervical
tissues can be damaged by:
+The neck being forced past its normal range of motion, such as in acar accident or sports injury
+ Constant, low-level stress, such
as from poor posture or a poorly set upworkspace
These may include:
+ Neck pain or stiffness
Pain in the shouiders or upper back
Muscle spasms
Headache, often starting at the base of the neck
+trritability,
troubée concentrating, or sleeplessness
Numbness in the arr or band
Tingling or weakness
inthe arm
This problem often gets better on itsown. Treatments aim tc reduce pain and inflammation and increase the range of
motion of the neck. Possible treatments include:
+Changes to your posture or sieep positions.
This can help ease muscle tension.
